# Diamond-Price-Prediction

A diamond distributor decided to put almost 2000 diamonds for auction. A jewellery company is interested in making a bid to purchase these diamonds in order to expand their business. As a data scientist, your job is to build a prediction model to predict the price of diamonds so that your company knows how much it should bid.

Things To DO:

Explore the diamond dataset by creating the following plots: 
  Box plots between each categorical feature and the price.
  Scatter plots between the numerical features and the price.
Convert categorical attributes into numerical attributes. 
Create a correlation heatmap for all the columns.
Build a linear regression model by selecting the most relevant features to predict the price of diamonds. 
Reduce multicollinearity (if exists) by eliminating highly correlated and high VIF features. 
Evaluate the linear regression model by calculating the parameters such as coefficient of determination, MAE, MSE, RMSE, mean of residuals and by checking for homoscedasticity.
